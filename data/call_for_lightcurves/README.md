# Call for Lightcurves

To test the effectiveness of different survey strategy simulations, it is very helpful to have sample populations of transient and variable objects to see what fraction are recovered.

In this directory, we provide `my_lc.py` and `objects.dat` as examples of a lightcurve generating function and a population of objects.

To donate new objects, branch or fork this repo, add a directory for your object, and provide a function and objects.dat file. Feel free to also include a jupyter notebook that illustrates a few lightcurves. A sample of 1-10 thousand objects is usually sufficient.
